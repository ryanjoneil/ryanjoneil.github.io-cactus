<p>In response to <a href="2011-10-25-know-your-time-complexities.html">this</a> post, <a href="http://www.indopedia.org/index.php?title=Ben_Bitdiddle">Ben Bitdiddle</a> inquires:</p>

<blockquote>"I understand the concept of using a companion set to remove duplicates from a list while preserving the order of its elements.  But what should I do if these elements are composed of smaller pieces?  For instance, say I am generating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination">combinations</a> of numbers in which order is unimportant.  How do I make a set recognize that [1,2,3] is the same as [3,2,1] in this case?"</blockquote>

<p>There are a couple points that should help here:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>While lists are unhashable and therefore cannot be put into sets, tuples are perfectly capable of this.  Therefore I cannot do:</p>
<pre>
>>> s = set()
>>> s.add([1,2,3])
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
</pre>
<p>But this works just fine <i>(extra space added for emphasis of tuple parentheses)</i>:</p>
<pre>
>>> s.add( (1,2,3) )
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>(3,2,1) and (1,2,3) may not hash to the same thing, but tuples are easily sortable.  If I sort them before adding them to a set, they look the same:</p>
<pre>
>>> tuple(sorted( (3,2,1) ))
(1, 2, 3)
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If I want to be a little fancier, I can user <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations">itertools.combinations</a>.  The following generates all unique 3-digit combinations of integers from 1 to 4:</p>

<pre>
>>> from itertools import combinations
>>> list(combinations(range(1,5), 3))
[(1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4)]
</pre>

<p>Now say I want to only find those that match some condition.  I can add a filter to return, say, only those 3-digit combinations of integers from 1 to 6 that multiply to a number divisible by 10:</p>

<pre>
>>> list(filter(
        lambda x: not (x[0]*x[1]*x[2]) % 10,
        combinations(range(1, 7), 3)
    ))
[(1, 2, 5), (1, 4, 5), (1, 5, 6), (2, 3, 5), (2, 4, 5),
 (2, 5, 6), (3, 4, 5), (3, 5, 6), (4, 5, 6)]
</pre>
