<p>One of the difficulties we encounter in solving the <a href="http://www.tsp.gatech.edu/">Traveling Salesman Problem</a> (TSP) is that, for even a small numer of cities, a complete description of the problem requires a factorial number of constraints.  This is apparent in the standard formulation used to teach the TSP to OR students.  Consider a set of $n$ cities with the distance from city $i$ to city $j$ denoted $d_{ij}$.  We attempt to minimize the total distance of a tour entering and leaving each city exactly once.  $x_{ij} = 1$ if the edge from city $i$ to city $j$ is included in the tour, $0$ otherwise:</p>

<p><center>
<table><tr><td valign="top">$\min$</td><td colspan="5">$z = \sum_i \sum_{j\ne i} d_{ij} x_{ij}$</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">s.t.</td><td align="right">$\sum_{j\ne i} x_{ij}$</td><td valign="top">$=$</td><td valign="top">$1$</td><td valign="top">$\forall i$</td><td align="right" valign="top">leave each city once</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td align="right">$\sum_{i\ne j} x_{ij}$</td><td valign="top">$=$</td><td valign="top">$1$</td><td valign="top">$\forall j$</td><td align="right" valign="top">enter each city once</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td align="right">$x_{ij}$</td><td>$\in$</td><td>${0,1}$</td><td>$\forall i, j$</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
</center></p>

<p>This appears like a reasonable formulation until we solve it and see that our solution contains disconnected subtours.  Suppose we have four cities, labeled $A$ through $D$.  Connecting $A$ to $B$, $B$ to $A$, $C$ to $D$ and $D$ to $C$ provides a feasible solution to our formulation, but does not constitute a cycle.  Here is a more concrete example of two disconnected subtours {(1,5),(5,1)} and {(2,3),(3,4),(4,2)} over five cities:</p>

<p>
<pre>ampl: display x;
x [*,*]
:   1   2   3   4   5    :=
1   0   0   0   0   1
2   0   0   1   0   0
3   0   0   0   1   0
4   0   1   0   0   0
5   1   0   0   0   0
;
</pre>
</p>

<p>Realizing we just solved the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem">Assignment Problem</a>, we now add subtour elimination constraints.  These require that any proper, non-null subset of our $n$ cities is connected by at most $n-1$ active edges:</p>


<p><center>$\sum_{i \in S} \sum_{j in S} x_{ij} \leq |S|-1 \forall S \subset {1, ..., n}, S \ne O$</center></p>

<p>Indexing subtour elimination constraints over a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set">power set</a> of the cities completes the formulation. However, this requires an additional $\sum_{k=2}^{n-1} \left(\matrix{n \cr k}\right)$ rows tacked on the end of our matrix and is clearly infeasible for large $n$.  The most current computers can handle using this approach <a href="http://zimpl.zib.de/download/zimpl.pdf">is around 19 cities</a>.  It remains an instructive tool for understanding the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion">combinatorial explosion</a> that occurs in problems like TSP and is worth translating into a modeling language.  So how does one model it on a computer?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="http://ampl.com/">AMPL</a>, the gold standard in mathematical modeling languages, is unable to index over sets.  Creating a power set in AMPL requires going through <a href="http://tomopt.com/ampl/service/sets.php#HowcanIgetAMPLtoindexoverthepowersetconsistingofallsubsetsofaset">a few contortions</a>.  The following code demonstrates power and index sets over four cities:</p>

<p>
<pre>set cities := 1 .. 4 ordered;

param n := card(cities);
set indices := 0 .. (2^n - 1);
set power {i in indices} := {c in cities: (i div 2^(ord(c) - 1)) mod 2 = 1};

display cities;
display n;
display indices;
display power;
</pre></p>

<p>This yields the following output:</p>

<p><pre>set cities := 1 2 3 4;

n = 4

set indices := 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15;

set power[0] := ; # empty
set power[1] := 1;
set power[2] := 2;
set power[3] := 1 2;
set power[4] := 3;
set power[5] := 1 3;
set power[6] := 2 3;
set power[7] := 1 2 3;
set power[8] := 4;
set power[9] := 1 4;
set power[10] := 2 4;
set power[11] := 1 2 4;
set power[12] := 3 4;
set power[13] := 1 3 4;
set power[14] := 2 3 4;
set power[15] := 1 2 3 4;
</pre></p>

<p>Note how the index set contains an index for each row in our power set.  We can now generate the subtour elimination constraints:</p>

<p><pre>var x {cities cross cities} binary;
s.t. subtours {i in indices: card(power[i]) > 1 and card(power[i]) < card(cities)}:
sum {(c,k) in power[i] cross power[i]: k != c} x[c,k] <= card(power[i]) - 1;

expand subtours;

subject to subtours[3]:  x[1,2] + x[2,1] <= 1;
subject to subtours[5]:  x[1,3] + x[3,1] <= 1;
subject to subtours[6]:  x[2,3] + x[3,2] <= 1;
subject to subtours[7]:  x[1,2] + x[1,3] + x[2,1] + x[2,3] + x[3,1] + x[3,2] <= 2;
subject to subtours[9]:  x[1,4] + x[4,1] <= 1;
subject to subtours[10]: x[2,4] + x[4,2] <= 1;
subject to subtours[11]: x[1,2] + x[1,4] + x[2,1] + x[2,4] + x[4,1] + x[4,2] <= 2;
subject to subtours[12]: x[3,4] + x[4,3] <= 1;
subject to subtours[13]: x[1,3] + x[1,4] + x[3,1] + x[3,4] + x[4,1] + x[4,3] <= 2;
subject to subtours[14]: x[2,3] + x[2,4] + x[3,2] + x[3,4] + x[4,2] + x[4,3] <= 2;
</pre></p>

<p>While this does work, the code for generating the power set looks like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voodoo_programming"voodoo>voodoo</a>.  Understanding it required piece-by-piece decomposition, an exercise I suggest you go through yourself if you have a copy of AMPL and 15 minutes to spare:</p>

<p><pre>set foo {c in cities} := {ord(c)};
set bar {c in cities} := {2^(ord(c) - 1)};
set baz {i in indices} := {c in cities: i div 2^(ord(c) - 1)};
set qux {i in indices} := {c in cities: (i div 2^(ord(c) - 1)) mod 2 = 1};

display foo;
display bar;
display baz;
display qux;
</pre></p>

<p>This may be an instance where open source leads commercial software.  The good folks who produce the <a href="http://zibopt.zib.de/">ZIB Optimization Suite</a> provide an AMPL-like language called <a href="http://zimpl.zib.de/">ZIMPL</a> with a few additional useful features.  One of these is power sets.  Compared to the code above, doesn't this look refreshing?</p>

<p><pre>set cities := {1 to 4};

set power[] := powerset(cities);
set indices := indexset(power);
</pre></p>
