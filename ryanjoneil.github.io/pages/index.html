    <h3>Hi, I'm Ryan</h3>

    <p>I'm an operations research analyst, data scientist, and coder by day, Ph.D. student in optimization by night, <a href="blog.html">blogger</a>, and amateur cellist.</p>
    
    <p>My research applies mathematical optimization techniques to cloud computing. I work on it under the direction of my advisor, <a href="http://seor.gmu.edu/~khoffman/">Dr. Karla Hoffman</a>. I'm also interested in cutting and packing problems, scheduling, modeling languages, computational optimization, and other miscellaneous operational and data science topics.</p>
   	
   	<p>Here are some of the things I've been working on lately.</p>

    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <ul>
    	<li>
    		<a href="ryanjoneil.github.io/blog.html">adventures in optimization</a> is a blog about optimization, data science, and computer programming.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		<a href="https://github.com/ryanjoneil/decision-models-for-data-science">Decision Models for Data Science</a>
    		is a work in progress with fellow doctoral candidate <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saba-neyshabouri-3a751940">Saba Neyshabouri</a> about making decisions using data science and optimization models. It explores linear, logical, and stochastic models for solving complex problems. It uses data to understand the structure and uncertainty inherent to such systems.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		My dissertation has the working title <em>The Docker Image Construction Problem</em>. It explores techniques to reduce the cost of maintaining large Docker infrastructure with combinatorial optimization and graph theory.
